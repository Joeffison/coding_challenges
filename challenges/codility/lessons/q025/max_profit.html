    <p>
      An array A consisting of N integers is given.
      It contains daily prices of a stock share for a period of N consecutive days.
      If a single share was bought on day P and sold on day Q, where 0 ≤ P ≤ Q &lt; N,
      then the <i>profit</i> of such transaction is equal to A[Q] − A[P], provided that A[Q] ≥ A[P].
      Otherwise, the transaction brings <i>loss</i> of A[P] − A[Q].
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider the following array A consisting of six elements such that:
    </p>
<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  A[0] = 23171
  A[1] = 21011
  A[2] = 21123
  A[3] = 21366
  A[4] = 21013
  A[5] = 21367</tt>
    <p>
      If a share was bought on day 0 and sold on day 2, a loss of 2048 would occur
      because A[2] − A[0] = 21123 − 23171 = −2048. If a share was bought on day 4 and sold on day 5,
      a profit of 354 would occur because A[5] − A[4] = 21367 − 21013 = 354.
      Maximum possible profit was 356. It would occur if a share was bought on day 1 and sold on day 5.
    </p>

    <p>Write a function,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>def solution(A)</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>that, given an array A consisting of N integers containing daily prices of a stock share for
      a period of N consecutive days, returns the maximum possible profit from one transaction during this period.
      The function should return 0 if it was impossible to gain any profit.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
    </p>
<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  A[0] = 23171
  A[1] = 21011
  A[2] = 21123
  A[3] = 21366
  A[4] = 21013
  A[5] = 21367</tt>
    <p>
      the function should return 356, as explained above.
    </p>

    <p>Assume that:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
        <li>
          N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">400,000</span>];
        </li>

        <li>
          each element of array A is an integer within
          the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">200,000</span>].
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Complexity:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
        <li>
          expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
        </li>

        <li>
          expected worst-case space complexity is O(1),
          beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
        </li>
      </ul>
