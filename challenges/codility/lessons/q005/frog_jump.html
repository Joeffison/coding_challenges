        <p>A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.</p>
        <p>Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.</p>
        <p>Write a function:</p>
        <blockquote><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>def solution(X, Y, D)</tt></p></blockquote>
        <p>that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.</p>
        <p>For example, given:</p>
        <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30</tt>
        <p>the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:</p>
        <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40</li>
        <li>after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70</li>
        <li>after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote><p>Assume that:</p>
        <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>X, Y and D are integers within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">1,000,000,000</span>];</li>
        <li>X â‰¤ Y.</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote><p>Complexity:</p>
        <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);</li>
        <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).</li>
        </ul>
