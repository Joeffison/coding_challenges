      <p>A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">A</tt>, <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">C</tt>, <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">G</tt> and <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">T</tt>, which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide has an <i>impact factor</i>, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">A</tt>, <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">C</tt>, <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">G</tt> and <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">T</tt> have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?</p>
      <p>The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">S[0]S[1]...S[N-1]</tt> consisting of N characters. There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers. The K-th query (0 ≤ K &lt; M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).</p>
      <p>For example, consider string S = <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">CAGCCTA</tt> and arrays P, Q such that:</p>
      <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6</tt>
      <p>The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:</p>
      <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">G</tt> and <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">C</tt> (twice), whose impact factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.</li>
      <li>The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">T</tt>, whose impact factor is 4, so the answer is 4.</li>
      <li>The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides, in particular nucleotide <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">A</tt> whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.</li>
      </ul>
      </blockquote><p>Write a function:</p>
      <blockquote><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>def solution(S, P, Q)</tt></p></blockquote>
      <p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed string S consisting of N characters and two non-empty zero-indexed arrays P and Q consisting of M integers, returns an array consisting of M integers specifying the consecutive answers to all queries.</p>
      <p>The sequence should be returned as:</p>
      <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>a Results structure (in C), or</li>
      <li>a vector of integers (in C++), or</li>
      <li>a Results record (in Pascal), or</li>
      <li>an array of integers (in any other programming language).</li>
      </ul>
      </blockquote><p>For example, given the string S = <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">CAGCCTA</tt> and arrays P, Q such that:</p>
      <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6</tt>
      <p>the function should return the values [2, 4, 1], as explained above.</p>
      <p>Assume that:</p>
      <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
      <li>M is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span class="number">50,000</span>];</li>
      <li>each element of arrays P, Q is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">N − 1</span>];</li>
      <li>P[K] ≤ Q[K], where 0 ≤ K &lt; M;</li>
      <li>string S consists only of upper-case English letters <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">A, C, G, T</tt>.</li>
      </ul>
      </blockquote><p>Complexity:</p>
      <blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N+M);</li>
      <li>expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).</li>
      </ul>
