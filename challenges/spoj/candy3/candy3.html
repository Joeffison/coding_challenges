      A class went to a school trip. And, as usually, all <b>N</b> kids have got their backpacks stuffed with candy.
      But soon quarrels started all over the place, as some of the kids had more candies than others.
      Soon, the teacher realized that he has to step in:
      "Everybody, listen! Put all the candies you have on this table here!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon, there was quite a large heap of candies on the teacher's table.
      "Now, I will divide the candies into <b>N</b> equal heaps and everyone will get one of them."
      announced the teacher.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Wait, is this really possible?" wondered some of the smarter kids.
