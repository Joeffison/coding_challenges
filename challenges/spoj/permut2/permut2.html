    <p>
      Some programming contest problems are really tricky:
      not only do they require a different output format from what you might have expected,
      but also the sample output does not show the difference.
      For an example, let us look at permutations.<br>
      A <b>permutation</b> of the integers <i>1</i> to <i>n</i> is an ordering of these integers.
      So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order.
      With <i>n = 5</i>, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. <br>
      However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation:
      You create a list of numbers where the <i>i</i>-th number
      is the position of the integer <i>i</i> in the permutation.
      Let us call this second possibility an <b>inverse permutation</b>.
      The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. <br>
      An <b>ambiguous permutation</b> is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation.
      The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same.
      To get rid of such annoying sample test cases,
      you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.
    </p>

    <h3>Input Specification</h3>
    <p>
      The input contains several test cases.<br>
      The first line of each test case contains an integer <i>n</i>(<i>1 ≤ n ≤ 100000</i>).
      Then a permutation of the integers <i>1</i> to <i>n</i> follows in the next line.
      There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers.
      You can assume that every integer between <i>1</i> and <i>n</i> appears exactly once in the permutation. <br>
      The last test case is followed by a zero.
    </p>

    <h3>Output Specification</h3>
    <p>
      For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not.
      Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.
