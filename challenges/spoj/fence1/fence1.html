    <p>
      There is a wall in your backyard. It is so long that you canâ€™t see its endpoints.
      You want to build a fence of length <em>L</em>
      such that the area enclosed between the wall and the fence is maximized.
      The fence can be of arbitrary shape, but only its two endpoints may touch the wall.
    </p>

    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
      The input consists of several test cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every test case, there is only one integer <em>L</em> (1&lt;=<em>L</em>&lt;=100),
      indicating the length of the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input ends with <em>L</em>=0.
    </p>

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
      For each test case, output one line containing the largest area.
      Your answer should be rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point.
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
1
0

<strong>Output:</strong>
0.16</pre>
